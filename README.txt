### OpenKore 1.9.3 (beta)
=========================

I'm happy to announce the 4th beta release of OpenKore, version 1.9.3. It hasn't been easy - many developers were busy with their real lives. Some new contributors joined us while others left. I'd like to give my thanks to the following people, who have contributed to this release. Without them OpenKore would not be what it is today. :)

- piroJOKE: server information updates and table files updates,
  labels idea, partial servertype 13 support.
- Click: improved shop list randomization.

- And of course, everybody in the existing OpenKore team. :) See http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/openkore

Here's a summary of the major changes in this release:
- When you start OpenKore, it will show you a friendly web interface, 
  in which you can read project news (such as new OpenKore releases).
  You can also use it to open the OpenKore configuration folder, to choose a 
  language and to start OpenKore.
- Lots and lots of bugs have been fixed. Most notably, many crashers, UTF-8 (character set handling) bugs and AI bugs have been fixed.
- Support for the following servers has been restored: vRO (Vietnam), rRO (Russia), euRO (Europe). Note that you need the ropp plugin in order to play on any of these servers.
- Support for new classes, such as Gunslinger and Ninja.
- We now support more platforms. OpenKore should now work correctly on FreeBSD, MacOS X and Sun Sparc.
- OpenKore has been translated to traditional Chinese.
- About 30% performance improvement compared to 1.9.2. This is because debugging has been disabled in this release.
