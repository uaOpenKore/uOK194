# This file allows specific AI control for certain monsters
#
# Syntax:
# <monster> <attack> <teleport> <search> <skillcancel> <lv> <joblv> <hp> <sp> <weight>
#
# <monster>:  Name of monster as found in monsters.txt (not case sensitive)
#
# <attack>:
# -1 means to leave the monster alone, even if it attacks you.
#  0 means to leave the monster alone, unless it attacks you.
#  1 means to always auto-attack this monster.
#  2 means always aggressive, auto-attack this monster when it appears, even if sitting.
#  3 means to attack the monster once (provoke) then leave it, useful for mobbing.
#
# <teleport>: Put a 1 to teleport if the monster is on the screen,
# or 2 to teleport if the monster attacks you.
# This is only used in auto-attack mode.
#
# <search>: Put a 1 to only attack the monster in the search mode.
# This is only used in auto-attack mode.
#
# <skillcancel>: Set to 1 if you want to interrupt spells casted by this
# monster.
#
# <lv>: Only auto-attack this monster if your level is higher than the
# specified level.
#
# <joblv>: Only auto-attack this monster if your job level is higher than
# the specified level.
#
# <hp>: Only auto-attack this monster if your HP is higher than the
# specified amount. The HP is not specified in percentage.
#
# <sp>: Only auto-attack this monster if your SP is higher than the
# specified amount. The SP is not specified in percentage.
#
# <weight>: Counts this monster as the specified amount aggressives. Supports floating point numbers (eg 1.8237402).
# Example:
#	(config.txt)
#	teleportAuto_minAggressives 6
#	teleportAuto_minAggressivesInLock 6
#
#	(mon_control.txt)
#	Hydra 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.2
#	Merman 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
#
#	If there's five hydras and two sword fish attacks the bot, it won't
#	teleport away since the aggressives are counted as 5*0.2 + 2*1 = 3
#	However, two marcs and two merman will make it tele away because
#	it sees 2*1* + 2*2 = 6 aggressives.
#
#
# Monsters not found in this file, or flags not specified will default to:
# <attack> = 1
